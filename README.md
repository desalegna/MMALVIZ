# MMALVIZ: Multimodal Malware Visualization Dataset

## Overview

The **MMALVIZ: Multimodal Malware Visualization Dataset** is designed for malware detection and classification research, using dynamic analysis of malware samples. The dataset contains 888 samples across seven malware classes, each represented by PNG images:
- **RGB images** derived from API call sequences, stored in `/api_call_images/`.
- **Grayscale images** derived from network traffic data, stored in `/network_traffic_images/`.

## Dataset Details
- **Total Samples**: 888
- **Malware Classes**: 7 (Cryptbot, Formbook, Remcos, Rokrat, Stealc, Vidar, Xworm)
- **Sample Distribution**:
  | Malware Class | API Call | Network Traffic | Total |
  |---------------|----------|-----------------|-------|
  | Cryptbot      | 14       | 44              | 58    |
  | Formbook      | 15       | 268             | 283   |
  | Remcos        | 15       | 156             | 171   |
  | Rokrat        | 14       | 129             | 143   |
  | Stealc        | 15       | 88              | 103   |
  | Vidar         | 15       | 88              | 103   |
  | Xworm         | 14       | 13              | 27    |
  | **Total**     | **102**  | **786**         | **888** |
- **Note**: The dataset includes 102 API call sequences (transformed into RGB PNGs) and 786 network traffic captures (transformed into grayscale PNGs). The variation between total samples (888) and the number of API call/network traffic instances arises because each sample may generate a different number of API call sequences or network traffic captures during dynamic analysis.
- **Image Format**: PNG
  - RGB PNGs (3 channels) for API calls
  - Grayscale PNGs (single channel) for network traffic
- **Labels**: Specific malware class
- **Purpose**: Malware detection, classification, and behavioral analysis.

## Data Source
- **Analysis Method**: Dynamic analysis conducted using Cuckoo Sandbox.
- **API Calls**: Extracted from JSON reports generated by Cuckoo Sandbox during malware execution. These reports contain detailed sequences of Windows API calls made by the malware.
- **Network Traffic**: Captured as PCAP files during sandboxed execution of malware samples.
